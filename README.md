A Cypherpunk Chronicle of the New Millenium.


**Preface**
In early 2021 mass deplatforming of accounts contra to the official narrative occurred. The world didn't end in the year 2000, and no Y2K disasters came to pass. Some argue the [Rodney King reaction riots](https://www.npr.org/2017/04/26/524744989/when-la-erupted-in-anger-a-look-back-at-the-rodney-king-riots) of 1992 shifted the way we consume news, ushering in the "If it bleeds, it leads" news cycle. The news became less about reporting facts and journalistic integrity. Instead, we started to see shock journalism and narrative led pieces reinforced by a 24-hour news cycle. In retrospect, this hyperfocus helped acclimatize us to the current polarized way of reporting and consuming information.

In mid-2020 identity politics rose to a hysterical crescendo of SJW nonsense clashing against a rise in patriotic values and idealism. In western media, you belonged to one of two camps: the left, fighting for social justice; or the right, fighting for a return to patriotic/nationalist ideals. Always on, always engaged social media along with corporate mass media propagated echo chambers further reinforcing this social division.

It's currently January 12, 2021. Mass censorship of right-leaning accounts began on January 6th when Twitter temporarily suspended sitting American President Donald J. Trump claiming three of his posts incited violence. Within a few days that suspension became permanent and a less than a week later entire points of view are being wiped from all social platforms, worldwide. This mass-cleansing extends in some cases to actual platforms as we saw Twitter competitor Parler denied service from *all* service providers including legal council; disappearing from app stores within 24 hours and the internet in less than 48. It seems we've learned nothing from history.

The public square is where ideas are discussed, examined and critiqued in the open air. We've had this, at least in concept, over several mediums throughout the rise and fall of multiple civilizations. When we become deprived of this public forum, for whatever reason, society becomes a uniculture of "right-think" while those who question the narrative are put figuratively and sometimes literally to death. Once again, disturbing trends to re-educate, punish, ostracize, contain and cancel arise.

Look to the next chapters for a more detailed accounting of events.
