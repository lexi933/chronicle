Please keep an offline copy of your work. Feel free to fork the repo or submit a pull request when your contribution is ready for review. You're also welcome to email drafts to: advancetechmedia@protonmail.com

A factual accounting of events is important and so does your individual point of view. There is no tone, central voice or style guide you must stick to.

Mixed media, art, memes - all welcome.
